# wecehacks' 24
WECE @ UIUC
WECEHacks, our annual hackathon, is coming up in late March during WECE Week at UIUC. This year, we're thrilled to announce that the event will primarily focus on hardware innovation, with a main focus on audio engineering, mechatronics, and embedded systems. Participants will have the opportunity to use their creativity and engineering skills to design and build electronic musical instruments and learning more about topics like electromechanical devices, embedded programming, and FFT.
